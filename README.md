# Student Performance and Procrastination Predictor

This is a simple Python project that predicts a student's performance and procrastination risk based on daily habits.

The main idea of this project is to understand how machine learning works and how student behavior can affect results.

## What this project does

The program takes some inputs from the user like study hours, sleep, screen time, etc. Based on this data, it predicts:

* Expected marks
* Grade (A, B, C, D)
* Procrastination risk (in percentage)
* A simple suggestion for improvement

This helps in understanding whether a student is performing well or not.

## Features used

The model uses the following inputs:

* Study hours
* Sleep hours
* Screen time
* Attendance percentage
* Assignments completed
* Stress level

These factors are important because they affect both performance and productivity.

## How it works

First, a small dataset is created inside the program. This dataset contains sample student data along with marks and procrastination values.

Then the data is normalized so that all values are in a similar range. This helps the model learn properly.

After that, two models are trained:

* One model predicts marks (performance)
* One model predicts procrastination risk

When the user enters their data, the program processes it and gives the final output.

## How to run the project

1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Open the project folder
3. Run the Python file

Example:
python your_file_name.py

4. Enter your details when asked
5. The result will be displayed on the screen

## Example output

* Predicted Marks: 78.50
* Grade: B
* Procrastination Risk: 35%
* Suggestion: You are doing well, keep it up

## Why I made this project

I am a beginner in machine learning, so I wanted to build a simple project to understand how models work internally without using any external libraries.

## Future improvements

* Use a larger dataset
* Improve prediction accuracy
* Add graphs for better understanding
* Convert this into a web or mobile application

## Note

This project is made for learning purposes. The results may not always be accurate because the dataset is small.
